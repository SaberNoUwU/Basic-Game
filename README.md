Here is my "small" project me and my friend (Nghia Nguyen Duc) code in Python, mainly using Tkinter. 

**ABOUT:** A card game with multiple characters, items to choose from and a fun gameplay.

**RULES**:  

**HOW TO USE**: 

1) **Download to your Python library necessary modules** 

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

**NOTES**: For Debian/Ubuntu users, I recommend install those modules to your virtual environment

2) **Start the project**

`python3 Card_Game.py`
